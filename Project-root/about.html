        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Selfique started as a small idea at a kitchen table, when our founder
          noticed how difficult it was to find clothing that was comfortable,
          sustainable and stylish. What began as a passion for fashion quickly
          grew into a mission: to give everyone the opportunity to feel
          confident and authentic, without compromising on quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first collection consisted of just ten carefully designed pieces.
          But the enthusiasm of our customers showed us that there was a need
          for more: more fairly made clothing, more transparency and especially
          more brands that listen to real people. Today, Selfique has grown into
          an online shop where style, simplicity and comfort come together.
